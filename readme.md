# bootcamp-hw3 (Password Generator) by Andrew Bergheim

## Description
This is a basic responsive webpage including a Javascript application to generate passwords based on user criteria for characters and length. 
## Installation

The contents of this repository are ready to be hosted or used locally by the user, and rely on no server queries. The only requirement is some form of browser.   

## Usage

To generate a password, click on the generate password button and answer the prompt with a valid numerical input, then choose the options for the confirms based on preference. This will generate a password which will appear and screen and which can be copied either manually from the text box, or by pressing the copy to clipboard button. 

## Credits

Most components would not have been possible without the wonderful bootstrap documentation available at (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/getting-started/introduction/)

Special thanks to my instructors at the University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp, provided by Trinity Educational Services.
